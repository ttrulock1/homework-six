Okay, I am going to re-update the readme.md later, but for now here I want to say the following. When the user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When they view current weather conditions for that city, then they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. When you view the UV index, then they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. When they view future weather conditions for that city, then they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When they click on a city in the search history, then they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city. 

It satisfies all of the above acceptance criteria plus uses the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data. It uses`localStorage` to store persistent data.

In terms of deployment, application deployed at live URL. This actually was one of the most difficult parts to make work for me. Still, the application loads with no errors. The application GitHub URL submitted. The GitHub repository that contains application code.

Furthermore, application user experience is intuitive and easy to navigate. Application user interface style is clean and polished. Application resembles the mock-up functionality provided in the homework instructions.

Repository has a unique name. Repository follows best practices for file structure and naming conventions. Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc. Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages. Repository contains quality readme file with description, screenshot, and link to deployed application.

I submitted both of these: The URL of the functional, deployed application, and the URL of the GitHub repository. Finally, the repository contain a unique name and includes a readme describing the project, which is this document.
